Once you have entered your brand name, you can no longer update the name from your end. <br><br>This is because the license you purchase from Typogram is a lifetime brand license. You can edit your brand, making iterations and edits to your designs, free inside our app. We enforce the lifetime brand license by locking the brand name, so one license is truly,  for one brand.</p>\n<h3>I still want to change my brand name. What should I do?</h3>\n<p>Because we lock the brand name for the lifetime brand license, you cannot edit the brand name on your own and will have to contact us for a name change.
