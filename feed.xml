                <h1>How to use kerning feature to design letter spacing inside Typogram</h1>
<h2>The Kerning Step</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have finalized your logo in Distinctive Logo, your logo will appear on the kerning artboard, ready to be kerned. In the kerning step, you learn the importance of kerning and pay close attention to spaces between letters. </span></p>
<h2>Fine Tune Spacing with Select Gap </h2>
<h3>Select Gap </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on Select Gap, and click on the triangle selection icon to select specific gaps between letters. Once you have chosen your space, you can view info about your letter pair gap on the right side Info Panel. From there, you can adjust the gap using numbers or pressing the up “↑” or down arrow “↓” on your keyboard. You can also select multiple gaps and increase spacing. </span></p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/help/media/posts/7/SelectGap.gif" alt="Img: Use Select Gap to select specific gaps between letter pairs. You can select multiple gaps at once to adjust letter spacing. " width="1440" height="900">
<figcaption ><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use Select Gap to select specific gaps between letter pairs. You can select multiple gaps at once to adjust letter spacing. </span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Visualize Space with Flip View &amp; Highlight Gap </h2>
<h3>Highlight Gap</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on Highlight Gap to see the spaces between the letters shaded and visualized.</span></p>
<h3>Flip View</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on Flip View to flip the design upside down. Seeing designs upside down helps you visualize the space between letter better, and you can make improved adjustments in the gaps. </span></p>

Highlight Gap highlights the shapes created by gaps in letter pairs. Both help you visualize the space better." width="1440" height="900">

                <h1>How to Select Brand Color in Typogram? </h1>
<p>In the brand color step, you learn the importance of color for branding and choosing your brand color.</p>
<hr>
<h2>HSL sliders &amp; Preview</h2>
<p>Click on the slider to change brand colors. Move the thumb along the Pigment Color Slider to change the shade of color, move along Pigment Density to change how muted or saturated the color is, and finally, move along the Mixing Black or White slider to make your brand color darker or lighter.</p>
<p>You can preview the brand color on the graphic as you select your brand color. The chosen color's hex code, useful for many design and marketing applications, is also available at the bottom.</p>

<h2>View Tips</h2>
<p>Toggle on to view tips about each color as you slide through different colors on the slider. If you wish to hide the tips, toggle on the view tips button again.</p>

<h2>Brand Color Info Panel</h2>
<p>The Info panel has information about the selected color, hue, saturation, and lightness values in numbers. In addition, we prepared helpful descriptions for each value range to provide insights into how the branding world uses specific colors, saturation, and lightness levels.</p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/help/media/posts/6/brandColor_hslSlider_infoPanel.gif" alt="Img: Info panel also has information about the selected color and their hue, saturation, lightness values" width="1440" height="900">

</figure>
<h2>Grayscale and Accent Colors</h2>
<p>Click on the link button to open a panel to manipulate the saturation. Click on “Add Accent Colors” to add accent colors to your brand colors. Typogram’s accent colors start as complementary colors to the brand colors, and you can adjust the color by clicking on the link button.</p>
<p>You can choose the number of colors you want to generate for both grayscale and accent colors.</p>

                <h1>Why can't I change my brand name?</h1>
<p>When you start a project in Typogram, you must enter your brand name. Once you have entered your brand name, you can no longer update the name from your end. <br><br>This is because the license you purchase from Typogram is a lifetime brand license. You can edit your brand, making iterations and edits to your designs, free inside our app. We enforce the lifetime brand license by locking the brand name, so one license is truly,  for one brand.</p>
<h3>I still want to change my brand name. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Because we lock the brand name for the lifetime brand license, you cannot edit the brand name on your own and will have to contact us for a name change. You can email customer support directly at wendy@typogram.co, or contact us through the chat widget inside the app. We usually will respond within 24 hours.</p>

<figcaption >Use the in-app chat widget for assistance</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>I just want to add an icon next to my brand name. How can I do that?</h3>
<p>Right now, this still needs to be done manually by contacting us, though we are working on a solution. Please email customer support directly at wendy@typogram.co or drop us a line in the chat widget.</p>

                <h1>Creaing design iterations using Artboard &amp; Gallery View </h1>
<p>If you have a design you like but would like to build new ideas on top of that existing design, you can duplicate the artboard to create backup versions of the concept you like and build on top of the copied versions. You can also switch to Gallery View to quickly compare all your design works.</p>
<h2>Duplicate Art Board</h2>
<p>The Duplicate Artboard feature allows you to create copies of artboards, making it possible to create alternate versions of your designs. Simply click on the duplicate icon to duplicate an artboard. You can do this action multiple times to create backup versions of designs or make new design iterations.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/help/media/posts/2/duplicateArtBoard.gif" alt="" width="1440" height="900"></figure>
<h2>Gallery View</h2>
<p>Gallery View can be accessible in the Distinctive Logo step via the tool panel. The Gallery View feature lets you view multiple artboards in a multi-column layout. With the Gallery View switched on, you can view all your artboards easily, compare your designs, and see your progress.</p>
